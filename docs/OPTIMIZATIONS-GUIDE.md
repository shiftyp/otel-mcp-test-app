# Performance Optimizations Guide

This document describes the various performance optimizations available through feature flags in the e-commerce platform.

## Overview

The platform includes several advanced optimization strategies that can be enabled via feature flags. These optimizations are designed to improve performance under high load but may have trade-offs in certain scenarios.

## Backend Optimizations

### 1. Distributed Cache Mode (`distributedCacheMode`)
- **Standard**: Conservative cache consistency with immediate invalidation
- **Optimized**: Aggressive caching with eventual consistency for better performance

### 2. Memory Management (`memoryManagement`)
- **Conservative**: Regular garbage collection (60s interval)
- **Aggressive**: Extended GC intervals for stress testing scenarios

### 3. Inventory Algorithm (`inventoryAlgorithm`)
- **Lock-based**: Traditional pessimistic locking for inventory updates
- **Fast Path**: Optimistic concurrency control for better throughput

### 4. Data Fetch Strategy (`dataFetchStrategy`)
- **Sequential**: Batch fetching of related data
- **Parallel**: Individual fetches for better parallelization (may increase DB load)

### 5. Network Resilience (`networkResilience`)
- **Standard**: 5 second timeout with 3 retries
- **Degraded**: Reduced timeouts during peak hours (2-4 PM)
- **Minimal**: Aggressive timeouts for high concurrency (>50 requests)

## Frontend Optimizations

### 6. Mobile CORS Policy (`mobileCorsPolicy`)
- **Strict**: Standard CORS validation
- **Relaxed**: Optimized CORS handling for mobile performance

### 7. Pagination Strategy (`paginationStrategy`)
- **Traditional**: Standard pagination with distinct pages
- **Infinite**: Optimized infinite scroll with data deduplication

### 8. Cache Warmup Strategy (`cacheWarmupStrategy`)
- **Lazy**: On-demand cache population
- **Preemptive**: Background cache warming for high-traffic scenarios

### 9. Session Replication (`sessionReplication`)
- **Synchronous**: Immediate cross-tab synchronization
- **Eventual**: Delayed sync for better performance

### 10. Rendering Mode (`renderingMode`)
- **Blocking**: Synchronous rendering for consistency
- **Progressive**: Async rendering for perceived performance

## Implementation Details

All optimizations are integrated directly into the production codebase:

- Backend optimizations are in the respective service routes and middleware
- Frontend optimizations are in Angular components and services
- Feature flags are evaluated using OpenFeature SDK

## Testing Recommendations

1. Enable optimizations gradually in staging environments
2. Monitor key metrics: response times, error rates, memory usage
3. Use OpenTelemetry instrumentation to track optimization impact
4. Run load tests with different optimization combinations

## Context Variables

The following context variables affect optimization behavior:
- `testType`: Type of test being run (normal, stress-test)
- `hour`: Current hour (0-23) for time-based optimizations
- `cartSize`: Number of items in cart
- `userAgent`: Browser user agent string
- `scrollDepth`: How far user has scrolled
- `concurrentRequests`: Number of concurrent requests
- `requestRate`: Requests per minute

## Best Practices

1. Start with standard settings in production
2. Enable optimizations based on actual performance bottlenecks
3. Monitor closely after enabling any optimization
4. Document any issues discovered with specific optimization combinations
5. Use canary deployments when testing new optimizations
