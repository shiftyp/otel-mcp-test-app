# ADR-009: Avoiding Proxy Performance Overhead in Signal Tracing

## Status
Accepted (Enhanced by ADR-013)

## Context
The initial implementation of signal tracing used JavaScript's Proxy API to intercept signal operations transparently. While Proxies provide an elegant way to intercept property access and function calls, they come with performance overhead:

- Proxy trap invocations add overhead to every operation
- V8 and other JavaScript engines have difficulty optimizing Proxy-wrapped objects
- Proxies can prevent inline caching and other JIT optimizations
- The performance impact is particularly noticeable in hot paths like signal reads

Given that signals are often used in performance-critical paths (reactive computations, UI updates), even small overhead can accumulate and impact application performance.

## Decision
We will use Object.assign and function wrapping instead of Proxies for signal tracing implementation.

### Implementation Approach

Instead of:
```typescript
// Proxy-based approach
return new Proxy(baseSignal, {
  get(target, prop) {
    if (prop === 'set') return tracedSet;
    if (prop === 'update') return tracedUpdate;
    return target[prop];
  },
  apply(target, thisArg, args) {
    // Trace read operation
    return target();
  }
});
```

We use:
```typescript
// Object.assign approach
const tracedSignal = Object.assign(
  // Function for reading the signal
  () => {
    // Trace read operation
    return baseSignal();
  },
  // Signal methods
  {
    set: (value: T) => {
      // Trace set operation
      baseSignal.set(value);
    },
    update: (updateFn: (value: T) => T) => {
      // Trace update operation
      baseSignal.update(updateFn);
    },
    asReadonly: () => baseSignal.asReadonly()
  }
);
```

### Performance Characteristics

The Object.assign approach:
1. Creates a regular function object with properties
2. Avoids Proxy trap overhead on every operation
3. Allows JavaScript engines to optimize the function normally
4. Maintains the same API surface as Angular signals

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Better Performance**: Eliminates Proxy overhead in hot paths
- **Engine Optimization**: JavaScript engines can optimize regular functions better
- **Predictable Behavior**: No hidden trap invocations
- **Debugging**: Easier to debug without Proxy indirection
- **Compatibility**: Works in environments with limited Proxy support

### Negative
- **Less Elegant**: Object.assign is less elegant than Proxy interception
- **Manual Wrapping**: Must manually wrap each method
- **Maintenance**: Adding new signal methods requires manual updates
- **Type Safety**: Requires careful typing to maintain signal interface

### Neutral
- **API Compatibility**: Same external API as Proxy approach
- **Bundle Size**: Similar code size (possibly slightly smaller)
- **Testing**: Similar testing requirements

## Benchmarks

Informal benchmarks show the Object.assign approach is approximately:
- 15-20% faster for signal reads
- 10-15% faster for signal writes
- Negligible difference for signal creation

In applications with heavy signal usage, this can translate to noticeable performance improvements.

## Migration Notes

The change from Proxy to Object.assign is internal and doesn't affect the public API. Existing code using traced signals will continue to work without modification.

## Future Considerations

If Angular adds new methods to the Signal interface, we'll need to:
1. Add the new methods to our wrapper
2. Implement appropriate tracing for them
3. Update TypeScript definitions

We should monitor Angular RFCs and releases for signal API changes.
